# Catchcore
Catchcore is a portmanteau between a hydrologic CATCHment and a CORE of a narrow cold frontal rainband (NCFR). An NCFR contains gaps and cores where cores are areas of very intense precipitation and gaps are areas of relatively light precipitation. When an NCFR core intersects with a catchment (or watershed) of interest, they become one--hence the name "Catchcore." This repository contains a Python segmentation algorithm meant to delineate the boundaries (or "catch") the NCFR "cores" intersecting with CATCHments of interest. More details to come later ;)
